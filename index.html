        <p class="lead mb-4">I went to my Earthquake Country professorâ€™s office hours. He explained a lot of the concepts that I didnâ€™t understand. In addition, it was really helpful because I literally went just before my first midterm for that class. I thought it was a good study session and it actually helped me during the midterm because some of the questions were actually related to what he went over in the office hours. The questions I asked were what was allowed on the exam and also some general questions about the material on the exam. As far as the information I received, I got a lot of info from the professorâ€™s answers to other studentâ€™s questions, who also visited him during the same office hours. From my perspective, the professor was really patient and explained everything clearly. He even created a funny analogy for one of the concepts that a student had trouble understanding. So, all in all, even though this is my hardest class this quarter, I have to admit the professor is the most engaging and passionate out of all my professors this quarter. He really helped me and a lot of people understand the material despite the majority of the class having no experience in learning the material whatsoever. However, it was my first time going to his office hours and I honestly am glad I did because the information I gained was very valuable and really helped me to succeed in the midterm. That being said, I do wish my midterm grade was a little higher, but luckily, he drops the lowest scoring midterm, so I should be fine. All things considered, I think the professorâ€™s office hours were really helpful and I would gladly go again.<br><br>

        Iâ€™ve gone to two of my T.A.â€™s office hours for my Earthquake Country class. Both times, I went because I wanted clarification on my assignments. Basically, I wanted to know if the answers I put were correct. So, the first time I went, I thought the T.A. was really helpful. He explained everything to me in great detail and answered all of my questions. The only slight complaint I have, which I understand is not the T.A.â€™s fault, is that sometimes, because of his heavy accent, it was a little hard to understand when he was saying certain earthquake-related terms. Other than that, I have no complaints and it was a pretty good experience. I also have him for my discussion section, which is pretty neat. The second time I went to my T.A.â€™s office hours, he actually wasnâ€™t there. He said that he didnâ€™t read his email and luckily, he actually arrived about an hour later. So, I just got clarification on one of my answers to one of the questions on one of his assignments. Incidentally, it was actually Halloween that day and no, the T.A. did not dress up. As far as the quality of answers I received from the T.A., I would probably give it an 8.5/10 and the reason for this is because there is a slight language barrier because of the T.A.â€™s heavy accent (again, Iâ€™m not saying I have anything against his accent, Iâ€™m simply stating that certain words were a little hard to understand, but I acknowledge it is not the T.A.â€™s fault). All in all, I think the T.A. was really great and his office hours were awesome.<br><br>
